# Intent Classification using ATIS Dataset for Natural Language Understanding

Intent Classification is a fundamental
task in Natural Language Understanding
that enables systems to interpret and
categorize user queries effectively. This
paper investigates the performance of
various machine learning techniques for
intent classification using the Airline Travel
Information Systems (ATIS) dataset.
Traditional approaches like Multinomial
Na√Øve Bayes and Logistic Regression, are
compared with advanced techniques like
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
with pre-trained GloVe embeddings and
BERT model. The models are evaluated
using accuracy and F1 score as metrics. The
results show a performance hierarchy, with
BERT achieving the highest accuracy of
95.4% and an F-1 score of 94.6%. These
findings highlight the superiority of
transformer-based models for intent
classification and their potential to enhance
travel-related virtual assistants.
